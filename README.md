Miscellaneous information for the Multipurpose Expansion Port (MEP) in OSGP Smart Meters.

The MEP port is accesable in a small plastic drawer in most Danish Echelon/NES Smart Meters. It other Meters and countries it is available on the screw terminals, but these might be hidden behind a sealed cover. It would probably be illegal for you to break this seal, so speak to your electrician and power company before messing with it!
